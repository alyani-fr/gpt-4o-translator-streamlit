<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project leverages the LLM model from OpenAI, GPT-4o to build a translator application that allows users to choose the input and output language of their choice. The UI used in this project is created using Streamlit to ensure a straightforward user experience. 
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Natural Language Processing</h3>
<ul>
 <li> Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o large language model to interpret natural language queries. </li>
 <li> Translates user's input into the chosen language. </li>
</ul>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Friendly User Interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Utilizes Streamlit interface to build the web application.</li>
  <li> Allow users to choose their choice of input and output languages.</li>
  <li> Consisting of a translate button to generate the desired output</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Workflow</h2>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è OpenAI Secret Key</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Generate the API key that was used to call on the llm model.</li>
  <li> Storing the secret key in a config.json file for a more efficient program architecture.</li>
</ul>
<h3>‚öíÔ∏è Modular Architectural Design</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Adopted a modular design by segregating functionalities into separate modules.</li>
  <li> Requirement file for installing all the required libraries, GPT-4o utilities for LLM model functionalities, Streamlit app page configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Throughout this project, I managed to demonstrate the deployment of an easy and smooth translator application with Streamlit while also showcasing the integration of OpenAI's llm model, GPT-4o and its language processing capabilities.
